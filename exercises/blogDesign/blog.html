                    The official website describes Wakanda as 
                    a fictional East African nation in Black Panther 
                    Movie and the New York Times also wrote last week
                    saying ““Black Panther” is a Hollywood movie, and 
                   Wakanda is a fictional nation.” The word Wakanda
                   may be a new term created for the movie but there 
                  is a Wakanada like country in Africa. It is not fictional
                  unless they want to plagiarize the facts and call it 
                  fictional, the story-line and the characters in the movie        
                  do happen to copy an existing country in East Africa: Ethiopia. 
                  Ethiopia is a nation in East Africa, which has never been colonized,
                 it defeated colonial Italy in 1896 at the Battle of Adwa. Perhaps                    to make it a product of his own creativity, the producer places 
                 Wakanda as country located between Uganda and Kenya but Ethiopia 
                 is a bit far from Uganda and doesn’t share borders.</p>

                <h4 class="bloghead headline2">The story</h4>

                <p class="blogs blog2"> <img class="images image2" src="wakanda.jpg">Another
                     explanation of the fact that the Black Panthers 
                    producers are actually depending on Ethiopian history is 
                    the use of a character, “the elder of one of the largest 
                    tribes in Wakanda” wearing a green suit and a clay disc 
                    on his lower lip/lip plating. In the lower Omo Valleys of 
                    South Western Ethiopia, girls of the marrying age still cut 
                    the lower lip plate a disc shaped clay in it. It is a sign 
                    of beauty. The men do not do this but Black Panther has used 
                    it for a man. “These are roles you don’t usually see a black 
                    person taking,” said Blen Sahilu, an Ethiopian lawyer and 
                    activist who has seen the movie three times. She singled out 
                    the role of Shuri, who is also the chief scientist of Wakanda, 
                    for its impact.</p>

                    Thanks to T’Challa, Wakanda is technologically advanced. 
                    In deed, Emperor Menelik II was the first Ethiopian and 
                    African King who introduced and adopted the most advanced 
                    technologies of the late 19th century to his people and 
                    country. Electricity, telegraph, printing press, train, 
                    hotel, cinema, schools, hospital and telecommunication, 
                    Menelik II technologized Ethiopia even when most African c
                    ountries did not even have any of them. The first to cycle 
                    and drive a car and the most techno-savvy Emperor. Not today’s 
                    Ethiopia! T’Challa’s characters are very much of Menelik II’s.
                    Except this time was different. Aside from having a civilization 
                    that dated back some 2,000 years, Ethiopia was also united for 
                    the first timed in centuries under Menelik,  who had also succeeded 
                    in buying modern weapons to arm his troops.</p>
