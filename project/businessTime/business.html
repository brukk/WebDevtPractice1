        <div class="pDiv"><p>  At The Barbershop A Hair Salon for Men, we are
          dedicated to providing the best value. We do this by providing high quality 
          salon services for men and boys, a unique customer focus, all in a warm, 
          friendly atmosphere. We have removed almost all of the pain from getting 
          a haircut. We think you will agree that sitting in our waiting room with a big HDTV, 
          lots of great magazines and the local newspaper, while shucking salted peanuts,
          doesn't make for too bad of a time. And fellas, that's just while you wait. 
          Your stylist will take you to your own private barber chair, and hand you the
          remote control for your own flat screen TV. And if that isn't enough, 
          not only will your stylist cut your hair, your stylist will give you a relaxing 
          shampoo and cooling conditioner, a hot soothing towel, trim your eyebrows and mustache, 
          and give you a shoulder rub with an old fashioned Oster massager. Let us earn your
           business, and we will do our best to make you want to come back, every time 
           you need a haircut.
