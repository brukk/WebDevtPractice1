      <p class="para" id="para1">Lfc is one of the best football clubs in the world. They
              won several trophiesin their ilastiust history.<span class="c1" id="ucl"> 5 UCL </span>,
              <span class="c1">18 leages </span> ,  <span class="c1">7 fa cups</span> ,
              <span class="c1">8 league cups</span> and more.Although they were a great 
              club in the 70s and 80s , the sleeping giants are still sleeping.It has been a 
              rollercoster of  a life in the clubs history, the success of trophies dried
              in the end of the 90s.

      <p class="para" id="para2">In the summer of 1998 Gerard Houllier was appointed 
          joint manager with Roy Evans. But that joint partnership was always destined 
          to end in failure and after four months together Roy Evans left the club. 
          Roy a great servant to the club was never a man to put himself before the 
          club whom he supported as a boy and worked himself up from fringe player to 
          first team manger. He later claimed in one of his last interviews that he didn’t 
          want to be a “Ghost on the Wall” which Is infact what his Autobiography title
           for his book which was published in 2004.

         <p class="para" id="para3">During a pre-season full of speculation Liverpool 
             made the massive coup in signing promising young manager Rafael Benitez
              from Valencia. “Rafa” as he is known faced an equally big task 
              in bringing together a squad littered with distinctly average players 
              rom the Houllier era. Purchases such as Luis Garcia, Xabi Alonso and 
              Fernando Morientes improved the outlook but the loss of Michael Owen 
              to Real Madrid marred Benitez’s opening months.Rafa Benitez’s first  
              season in charge saw the Reds land their first European Cup for 21 years,
               defeating AC Milan against the odds in the greatest European 
               Final ever witnessed.</p>
